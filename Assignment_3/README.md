Software-in-a-loop simulation
------------------------------

Controlling the robot arm model in the simulink via the controller code running on
the linux system. Using the embedded coder of the simulink to generate the controller
code from the controller model and also adding the mouse input to the controller.
Thus moving the robot arm via the mouse input.
